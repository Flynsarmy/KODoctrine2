1.08:
- Now works with and requires Doctrine 2.2

1.07:
- Added support for Kohana 3.2
- Removed debug text from /doctrine controller
- Load schema files from /models/fixtures/schema in any module
- Updated the /doctrine page with more information

1.06:
- Added support for Kohana 3.1
- Now works regardless of your folder structure!

1.05:
- Fixed SQL logger error when passing objects as parameters in DQL queries
- Added boolean printing to the SQL logger's DQL parameters

1.04:
- CLI tool now grabs Kohana DB information so you don't need to set it yourself
- Added --quiet flag to proxy generation so it won't throw an error when trying to
  add proxies that already exist
- Doctrine classes moved to 'vendor' folder
- Switched 'Validate Schema' and 'Load Schema' sections around on /doctrine - you're
  supposed to load first then validate.
- Only auto_load files in 'models\' namespace
- Added SQL Logging for last viewed page - saves to APPPATH.logs/SQLLog.php

1.03:
- Entities are no longer deleted before being regenerated. Generating from YAML/XML
  simply isn't flexable enough to cope with automatically generated entity files.
  This means you'll need to MANUALLY delete any annotations+fields you change in
  the data fixture before regenerating due to a bug in the generator script whereby
  existing annotations are never updated. This also means you can now safely add
  logic to your entities - it won't be deleted each generation.
+ Auth and Session drivers added
+ PDO support added

1.02:
- Entities may now be accessed from everywhere
- Entities are now deleted before being regenerated. This is done so that any
  changes to your schema files will always be applied when generating entities.
  It is present due to bugs in the generation script.
  See /doctrine2/classes/controller/doctrine "_process_action" function for
  more details.
